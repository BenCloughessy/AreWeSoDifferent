# Are We So Different?
  Inform and shift perspectives on homelessness through data-informed story.
  
# Functionality
  Are We So Different exists to be shared among communities, to inform and shift opinions, and to promote the HelpEasy mobile application.
  
# Why Now?
  Homelessness is on the rise in the U.S. and lack of understanding is rampant. It's naive to think that a website can change a man's heart. But information, presented 
  well and received at the right time, can make a difference. Enter, Are We So Different.

# Tech
  Basic SPA with HTML and CSS. Bootstrap for styling, Chart.js for graphics, and some vanilla JavaScript for the scroll bar navigation.
  
# Bugs
At present, I will be maintaining the site only sporadically. If you notice a new feature, I can be reached by email at cloughessybenjamin@gmail.com
